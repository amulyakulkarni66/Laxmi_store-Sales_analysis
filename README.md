# Laxmi Store Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a real-time sales analysis created for **Laxmi Store**, a local retail clothing outlet. Upon request from the shop owner, I independently took the initiative to analyze their sales data using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to deliver actionable insights on monthly performance, customer demographics, sales channels, and geographic trends. The final deliverable was a fully functional and interactive Excel dashboard designed to assist the business in making informed decisions regarding marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

## Objective

To provide meaningful insights from sales data that help the Laxmi Store improve sales performance, better understand its customer base, and optimize product distribution across various sales channels and regions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Monthly Sales and Order Volume  
- Gender-wise Sales Distribution  
- Age Group-wise Order Trends  
- Order Status Overview (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned, Refunded)  
- Top 5 States by Sales  
- Channel-wise Sales Contribution  

## Key Insights

- February recorded the highest sales volume, followed by March.  
- Women contributed to 64% of total sales, while men accounted for 36%.  
- Most purchases were made by adult and teenage women.  
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh were the top-performing states by revenue.  
- Meesho contributed the highest percentage of sales, followed by Flipkart and Myntra.  
- 92% of the total orders were successfully delivered, indicating strong order fulfillment performance.  

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel  
  - Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
  - Pivot Tables for summarization and aggregation  
  - Slicers and Charts for interactive dashboard elements  

## Dataset Description

The dataset included the following fields:
- Order and Delivery Dates  
- Customer Gender and Age Group  
- Product Categories  
- Sales Channel  
- Order Status  
- Revenue by Order  
- State-wise Order Information  

## My Contribution

- Collected, cleaned, and structured raw data shared by the Laxmi Store owner.  
- Designed and developed an interactive Excel dashboard tailored for non-technical users.  
- Presented key performance indicators and patterns using effective data visualization techniques.  
- Delivered strategic recommendations based on the insights generated.  

## Final Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions I recommended to the store:

1. **Focus Marketing on Women Buyers**: With over 60% of purchases made by women, particularly adults and teenagers, marketing efforts such as discounts, loyalty programs, and targeted ads should prioritize this customer segment.

2. **Leverage High-Performing Channels**: Increase investment in Meesho, Flipkart, and Myntra, which contributed the most to revenue. Low-performing platforms can be reviewed for cost-benefit analysis.

3. **Promotional Campaigns in Peak Months**: Since February and March showed the highest sales, running seasonal promotions or new product launches during these months may further boost revenue.

4. **State-Based Inventory Planning**: Prioritize inventory allocation and delivery services for Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, as they account for the majority of orders.

5. **Address Order Cancellations and Returns**: Although the fulfillment rate is high, reviewing the 8% of orders not delivered successfully can help identify operational gaps.

## Outcome

The Laxmi Store owner appreciated the insights and has started implementing some of the suggestions, particularly around focused promotions and channel optimization. This project enhanced my practical skills in data analytics and visualization while delivering value to a real business scenario.
